When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

	    When I work in a colaborative way with other programmers.
	    And if i could something cool for anyone to share and so they can make their own versions.
	    And if i have no acces to my own computer and I need to make some changes ASAP to my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

		Guess that is better have the last operational version on github since it is public. 
		I don't know I, think it is little subjective. If I have two computers and I make changes over the weekend or at night. so in the monday morning at office i would need that work ...So I have to make the push even if that version is not operational.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?


		Forks.- It is a special kind of clone but in the context of GitHub
		Clones.-It is when a copy of a commit history is made to the local computer through git
		Branches.-Is a point where we can make changes that are proof of concept and maybe not part of the final version or at least at the moment. I guess it is a special kind of clone.
